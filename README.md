# The awesome list of all the awesome lists

There are many awesome lists on GitHub. It is time to create the awesome list of all the awesome lists.

If for nothing else then to provide and opportunity for someone who has not contributed to a project via GitHub to try to send a pull-request.

## How to contribute?

* Find a repository with an awesome list on GitHub that is not yet listed in this list. You can find more by following one of the relevant topics:
    * [awesome](https://github.com/topics/awesome)
    * [awesome-list](https://github.com/topics/awesome-list)
    * [awesome-lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome-lists)
* Edit the README.md file adding the new entry.
* Send a pull-request.
  
* Bonus: Once your pull-request is accepted, visit the newly added awesome list and send them a pull-request linking to our list.
